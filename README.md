## My process

### Built with :

- React
- CSS custom properties
- React Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### List of commands :

``` npx create-react-app name ``` - to create the react app

``` npm start ``` -  to get the react project running

``` npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap ``` - to install react-bootstrap library

``` npm install animate.css --save ```

``` npm i react-on-screen ```

``` npm i react-multi-carousel ```

``` npm install express cors nodemailer ```

``` node server.js ```

``` npm i react-bootstrap-icons --save ```

``` npm install react-router-hash-link ```

### What I learned

Through this project i learned how to use javascript classes and constructors. I also learned a new function named reduce() which is basically used to get the sum of all the values in a list.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
if(this.itemList.length > 0){
    total = this.itemList.reduce(function(acc,curr){
    console.log(`total is ${acc} and the current value is ${curr.amount}`);
    acc += curr.amount;
    return acc;
    },0)
}
```


### Continued development

I want to further make improvements in the ui and maybe integrate a database to store the data.
